# NCMP Trend Leeds
This repo contains R script to produce interactive plot for NCMP Trend in Leeds.

The plot can be viewed here: http://rpubs.com/MarCa/leedsncmp. I've created it to explore these trends myself when I was reading https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/may/01/leeds-becomes-first-uk-city-to-lower-its-childhood-obesity-rate and https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ijpo.12529. The paper shows decrease of obesity prevalence in Leeds when analysed by deprivation deciles. The plot I've created doesn't have deprivation deciles!
